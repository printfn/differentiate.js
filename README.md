# differentiate.js

A JavaScript program that parses, differentiates and simplifies mathematical expressions.
This program uses the PEG.js parser generator to parse mathematical
expressions into an expression tree, then runs a recursive algorithm to
differentiate the expression, followed simplifying the tree and outputting the result.

### TODO

 - Better, simpler simplification of derivatives
 - More features (logs, exponents, etc.)
 - Better user interface
